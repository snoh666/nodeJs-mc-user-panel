# Minecraft User Panel API

  Routes have own time block period so they can be run once in a time thanks to firebase. Every time user connects to route it creates new rcon connection in case of server restarts.

## Packages installed
  - Express
  - cors (for no-cors prevention)
  - firebase (database managing and connection)
  - rcon (minecraft server connection sending commands and etc)
  - dotenv (securing rcon connection parametrs)
  - nodemon (automating server reload)
